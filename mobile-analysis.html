            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>This is my mobile page review for various pages.</p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>For the most part the sites I used did okay.  There were some that seemed too cluttered and some that just didn't work very well.  There's a site I use that allows me to check my <a href="http://wfms.afstores.com/ess/rp/login?redirectUrl=%2Fess%2Frp">work schedule</a>.  I couldn't get it to display anything, it kept giving me errors.  Amazon's mobile page, which I don't use much because I have the mobile app (which is quite nice), it seems like a shrunk down version of the desktop version... which is to be expected, I guess.  I didn't like it much though, it got what it needed to get across, across.  It just didn't look that nice, in my opinion.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Other than with the site I use to check my work schedule, I think mobile sites are getting to the point where they are working just fine.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>

            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="" target="_blank">Name of site</a></li>
