            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>This is my mobile page review for various pages.</p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>For the most part the sites I used did okay.  There were some that seemed too cluttered and some that just didn't work very well.  There's a site I use that allows me to check my <a href="http://wfms.afstores.com/ess/rp/login?redirectUrl=%2Fess%2Frp">work schedule</a>.  I couldn't get it to display anything, it kept giving me errors.  <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/">Amazon's</a> mobile page, which I don't use much because I have the mobile app (which is quite nice), it seems like a shrunk down version of the desktop version... which is to be expected, I guess.  I didn't like it much though, it got what it needed to get across, across.  It just didn't look that nice, in my opinion.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Other than with the site I use to check my work schedule, I think mobile sites are getting to the point where they are working just fine.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>For the most part.  I use reddit quite regularly from an unofficial android app called "Reddit is Fun".  The <a href="https://www.reddit.com">website</a> has a feature that allows you to hide comment chains.  On the mobile app you can select the comment and it'll bring up options for the comment.  You can hide, save, etc. On the mobile page you have to hit a tiny arrow to hide the comment which was a bit tedious.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Really only with the site I used to see my work schedule.  In order to actually get the the site, I have to use the 'Request Desktop Site' button on the Chrome mobile browser.  I then have to remove the "/mobile" from the url to make it work.  Super annoying when I just need to see when I work.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Other than the issue with the comment hiding I mentioned earlier, I really like the mobile layout of reddit.  It felt a lot cleaner in comparison to a desktop browser which is kind of overwhelming almost, especially if you've never used the site before.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I've learned to love the features that standalone apps give.  I still use my mobile browser for various things, but when there's a standalone app for a particular site that I use often... I think I'll stick with the apps or the desktop versions.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
